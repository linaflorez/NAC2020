Working through python basics for astronomy research

I'm detailing what I think is the basics to make your life a little easier when you start to do astronomy research. This doesn't encompass everything, but I'll give you as much information and as many resources as I can. As I developed this, I asked myself what I wish I had known when I had started research. I hope this will help you, and if there are any corrections I should make, let me know so I can make this even better!
